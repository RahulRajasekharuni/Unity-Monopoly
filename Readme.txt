Game Overview
-------------------
This is a Monopoly simulation game with two players. When the red button is pressed;
	• Dice will be rolled.
	• Player token will be moved to new location.
	• There will be a 50% chance the player will purchase the location if the conditions are met.
		 i. Location is purchasable.
		 ii. Player has enough money to purchase location.
		 iii. Location is not already owned.
Game will only last until either of the players goes around the board three times. Whenever the player passes the Go location he/she will receive 200 cash. 
If the player lands on one of the tax location he/she will lose the amount of cash that location specifies. The output button will write to file the dice rolls, names of properties owned and remaining cash of each player. 
The file is named output.txt and will be in the same folder as the executable.

Build Instructions
---------------------
I have already built the game, but if you need to test this yourself I suggest building it with windowed mode as default and a 16:9 resolution.

Time Spent
--------------------
This project took me roughly around 8-9 hours over three days.
